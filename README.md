# pw

A very basic password generator:

generates a password on the fly and pushes it to the clipboard.

Takes a positive argument as a password lenght. If no argument is provided, or the argument is of the erroneous type, a default value of 40 charachters is used.
Current generator uses <s>pseudorandom mix of ASCII charachters (upper and lower case), numbers, and special charachters.</s> `1-1000.txt` dictionary of most popular words in English to pick the non-spaced combo of approximatley the required lenght and adds one number and one special charachter at the end.

Made it just because couldn't find a decent pass generator with no drama attached.
